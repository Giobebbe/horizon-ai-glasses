# Rule: Initiate New Project

## Goal
To gather requirements from the user and generate a complete `project_spec.md` using the "Master Skeleton".

## The Interview Protocol
When the user wants to start a new project/website, Ask these **4 Golden Questions**:

1.  **"What are we building?"** (Name & Industry)
2.  **"Who is it for?"** (Target Audience)
3.  **"What is the Vibe?"** (e.g., Luxury, Playful, Apple-like, Brutalist)
4.  **"Any specific sections you need?"** (e.g., Pricing, Blog, Contact Form)

## The Generation Process
1.  **Analyze**: Take the user's answers.
2.  **Expand**: Use your creativity to "fill in the blanks" of `resources/project_brief_template.md`.
    *   *Invent* specific color codes if not provided.
    *   *Invent* copywriting headlines.
    *   *Invent* layout details suitable for the "Vibe".
3.  **Present**: Show the filled Markdown to the user for approval.
4.  **Save**: Once approved, save as `.docs/current_spec.md`.
